# Human Cognition Notebooks

This repository contains experiments and scripts focused on modeling human behavior attributes such as emotions, personality types, and the Big Five traits - some are useful in application, and some are for the sake of my curiousity.

The primary emphasis is on utilizing the latent space of language models to explore and understand humans - hopefully, to build a mind-map of human inferencing tools rather than relying on how much information a model's neurons can retain.
